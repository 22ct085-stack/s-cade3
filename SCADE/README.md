# S-CADE — Sustainable Tourism Recommendation System

S-CADE is a full-stack web application that finds real nearby attractions with Google Places, combines them with travel preferences and current weather, and explains a ranked shortlist of up to three places. The Local Business Discovery module combines nearby Google Places businesses with a verified MongoDB directory, removes duplicates, ranks matches, and lets visitors suggest missing community businesses for review. Its 360° Places page lets visitors select a real nearby attraction and open the closest available interactive Google Maps Street View panorama at that place. Coverage varies by location; the panorama may be on a nearby road rather than inside the attraction. Sustainability details are neutral unless supporting evidence has been reviewed by an admin.

## Architecture

- **Client:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Axios, and responsive CSS.
- **API:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Zod input validation, and Axios integrations.
- **Data:** MongoDB/Mongoose models for users, preferences, reviews, saved places, and verified local businesses. Attraction and Google-only business searches remain usable if MongoDB is disconnected; curated business records and submissions require MongoDB.
- **External services:** Google Places API (New) for attractions and location search; OpenWeather current weather endpoint for context. The UI remains usable when the weather service is unavailable. API keys stay on the server.
- **Recommendation scoring:** Deterministic and explainable. Optional Gemini integration can select from exact, precomputed explanation sentences; its output is checked against those sentences, so it cannot add claims. It falls back to deterministic explanations on errors.
- **360° place views:** Select a recommended attraction and open its interactive Street View panorama in Google Maps. No camera permission or browser API key is required. Google Maps shows the closest available panorama to the selected coordinates; coverage varies.
- **Local Business Discovery:** Search restaurants, cafés, bakeries, hotels, homestays, handicraft shops, local stores, and tourism services. Google listings are merged with nearby verified local records. Community suggestions stay pending until an admin reviews them.

## Requirements and installation

- Node.js 20 or newer and npm.
- MongoDB Community Server locally, or a MongoDB connection string. MongoDB is optional for the read-only recommendation flow.
- Google Cloud project with billing configured for Places API (New).
- OpenWeather API key for live weather context.

From the `SCADE` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and fill in the values you have. Do not put server keys in `client/.env` or commit `server/.env`.

## Environment variables

`server/.env` format:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash
BUSINESS_ADMIN_TOKEN=replace_with_a_long_random_admin_token
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/scade
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is used server-side for walking routes through Google Routes API. Keep it out of client environment files. `GEMINI_API_KEY` enables optional selection of precomputed explanations; if it is absent or fails, deterministic explanations are returned. `GEMINI_MODEL` defaults to `gemini-3.8-flash`. `MONGODB_URI` can be omitted for attractions and Google-only business searches, but is required for the curated business directory, community submissions, and admin review. `BUSINESS_ADMIN_TOKEN` protects staff endpoints; set a long random value only on the API server. Admins enter it at `/businesses/admin`; it stays in page memory and is sent via an `x-admin-token` header. The app needs `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` for places and location search and `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` for weather. Missing keys return useful configuration errors; weather failure does not prevent recommendations.

## Provider setup

### Google Places and Maps

1. Create/select a project in Google Cloud Console and configure billing.
2. Enable **Places API (New)**. The backend uses Nearby Search and Text Search from Places API (New).
3. Create an API key restricted to Places API (New), and store it as `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` in `server/.env`.
4. Enable **Routes API** in the same Google Cloud project. Create or use a server key restricted to Routes API and store it as `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `server/.env`. Billing must be enabled for both services.
5. The API returns Google Maps URLs for places when available. S-CADE also creates a coordinate-based Google Maps search link if a place URL is missing. No browser Maps JavaScript key is needed.


### OpenWeather

Create an API key in your OpenWeather account and set `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`. The backend calls the Current Weather endpoint using metric units. Weather details are optional context, not safety guidance.

### Gemini (optional)

Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to enable the optional Gemini explanation selector. It receives only the top three candidates and their deterministic explanations, then may select exact sentences from that list. Server-side validation rejects any new or altered text. On missing keys, service errors, malformed output, or unsupported sentences, the deterministic explanations remain in use. The recommendation score is never generated by Gemini.

## Run the application

In two terminals from `SCADE`:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace server
```

```bash
npm run dev --workspace client
```

Or run both with `npm run dev`. The API listens on `http://localhost:5000`; Vite serves the app at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` requests to the API. Production builds use `npm run build`; start the built API with `npm start --workspace server`. Preview the client build with `npm run preview --workspace client`.

## Deploy for mobile access

The Vite development proxy only works on the computer running the development server. A Git repository or static frontend host does not start the Express API. To use S-CADE from a phone over the internet, deploy the `server` as a publicly reachable Node service and the `client` as a static site (or serve both behind one domain).

For separate frontend and backend hosts:

1. Deploy the backend and set its server environment variables from `server/.env.example`. Set `CLIENT_URL` to the exact deployed frontend origin, such as `https://scade.example.com` (no trailing path). Add every additional allowed frontend origin as a comma-separated value.
2. Confirm the backend is reachable at `https://your-backend-host.example.com/api/health` and responds with the S-CADE health JSON.
3. In the frontend host's build environment, set `VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-host.example.com/api` using the actual backend URL. `client/.env.example` shows the format. Rebuild/redeploy the frontend after setting this value; Vite embeds it during the build.
4. Open the deployed frontend on the phone. Use HTTPS so browser location, camera, and motion permissions are available.

### Render setup

Deploy two Render services from the same Git repository. For both services, set the root directory to the folder containing the root `package.json`, `client/`, and `server/` directories. Leave it blank if that folder is the repository root.

**API web service**

- Build command: `npm ci && npm run build --workspace server`
- Start command: `npm start --workspace server`
- Health check path: `/api/health`
- Environment variables: `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`, `BUSINESS_ADMIN_TOKEN`, and `CLIENT_URL` (set the frontend origin after creating the static site). `MONGODB_URI` is required for the local directory/admin tools; `GEMINI_API_KEY` is optional. Render supplies `PORT`.

**Frontend static site**

- Build command: `npm ci && npm run build --workspace client`
- Publish directory: `client/dist`
- Build environment variable: `VITE_API_URL=https://<your-api-service>.onrender.com/api`
- Add a rewrite rule: source `/*`, destination `/index.html`, action **Rewrite**, so direct visits to React Router pages work.

Create and deploy the API first, then use its public URL for `VITE_API_URL`. After the static site deploys, set the API's `CLIENT_URL` to the exact static-site origin and redeploy the API. Keep all provider keys in the API service's environment settings; only the API base URL belongs in the frontend build environment. Render's web and static services receive managed HTTPS certificates for their `onrender.com` URLs.

Keep Google, weather, Gemini, and MongoDB secrets only in the backend environment. `VITE_API_URL` is public configuration and must contain no secrets. If the hosting provider supports a single domain with an `/api` proxy to Express, configure that proxy and the frontend can use the same-origin `/api` default instead.

## API endpoints

- `GET /api/health` — service health.
- `GET /api/places/nearby?latitude=11.4102&longitude=76.6950&radius=5000` — real nearby attractions (radius 100–50,000 m).
- `GET /api/places/search?query=Ooty` — place-name search for coordinates.
- `GET /api/recommendations?latitude=11.4102&longitude=76.6950&budget=medium&walking=false&sustainabilityPreference=0.5&travelType=nature` — ranked results, explanations, weights, and weather when available. `travelType` can be nature, historical, adventure, family, cultural, or relaxation.
- `GET /api/weather?latitude=11.4102&longitude=76.6950` — current weather.
- `GET /api/routes/walking?originLatitude=11.4102&originLongitude=76.6950&destinationLatitude=11.4054&destinationLongitude=76.6961` — walking route, encoded geometry, and turn instructions from Routes API.
- `GET /api/businesses/nearby?latitude=11.4102&longitude=76.6950&radius=5000&category=cafe&sustainabilityPreference=0.7` — nearby Google Places and verified MongoDB businesses, deduplicated and ranked. Category is optional; accepted values: `restaurant`, `cafe`, `bakery`, `hotel`, `homestay`, `handicrafts`, `local_store`, `tourism_service`.
- `POST /api/businesses/submissions` — accepts community suggestions as pending. JSON: `name`, `category`, `address`, `latitude`, `longitude`, plus optional `phone`, `website`, `openingHours`, `productsAndServices`, `sustainabilityClaim`, `sustainabilityEvidence`, `submittedBy`.
- `GET /api/businesses/admin/pending` — pending suggestions; requires `x-admin-token`.
- `POST /api/businesses/admin` — add an admin-curated verified business; requires `x-admin-token`.
- `PATCH /api/businesses/admin/:id/verify` — verify a pending business listing; requires `x-admin-token`. Sustainability requires a separate evidence review and `verifySustainability: true` with a score from 0–100.

Requests with invalid coordinates return HTTP 400. Missing API configuration returns HTTP 503. Provider/network failures return a sanitized HTTP 502 response. The API never returns credentials.

## Local Business Discovery

Visit `/businesses` to search around the selected location, category, and radius. Results are combined from Places API (New) and verified MongoDB records, deduplicated by Google place ID or normalized name plus nearby coordinates, then ranked by preference/category match, distance, availability, rating, local relevance, and sustainability. Each signal is normalized to 0–100, and API results include scores and their effective weights. The user's sustainability preference adjusts its weight from 5% to 20%; remaining weight is rescaled across other signals. Missing ratings, availability, and sustainability evidence use neutral values. No environmental claim is shown without evidence reviewed by an admin.

Visitors can submit businesses from the discovery page. Submissions stay pending and are not included in public results until reviewed at `/businesses/admin`. Configure `BUSINESS_ADMIN_TOKEN` on the API server and keep it private; the admin page holds the entered token in memory and sends it only to the API. Business verification and sustainability verification are separate. A local listing's coordinates use GeoJSON `[longitude, latitude]` and a MongoDB `2dsphere` index.

## Recommendation scoring

All component scores are normalized to 0–100. The final score is:

```text
(preferenceMatch × 0.25)
+ (distance × 0.20)
+ (context × 0.15)
+ (sustainability × 0.15)
+ (rating × 0.10)
+ (localRelevance × 0.10)
+ (availability × 0.05)
```

Distance uses the Haversine formula; nearer places score higher, and the walking preference weights distances against a closer target. Rating maps a 0–5 Google rating to 0–85, with a capped review-count contribution (up to 15 points). Context uses weather conditions to reduce the score for outdoor attractions during rain or thunderstorms; it does not make safety claims. Preference match combines travel-type relevance with Google Places' broad price level when available; missing price levels use a neutral partial score and are not presented as exact costs. Availability uses current opening status when Places supplies it. Local relevance stays neutral because Places does not provide a reliable local-versus-tourist measure. Google Places currently supplies no sustainability evidence to this app, so sustainability remains at 50/100, a neutral baseline for every place. This is not a sustainability assessment. The API returns up to three results; it will not fabricate cards if fewer than three real places are returned.

## AR walking navigation

Choose **Show walking route** from a recommendation to display the route inside S-CADE. The page requests location access, then loads walking directions and turn instructions. GPS updates refresh remaining distance and guidance, rerouting when the device moves well away from the route. The in-page OpenStreetMap view supports pan and zoom and marks the live position, route, and destination. Camera access is optional; switch to **AR View** to enable the compass-guided camera overlay. Arrival is detected within approximately 22 meters. Walking routes may not show clear sidewalks or pedestrian paths; follow local signs and use crossings.

This browser implementation is sensor-based guidance rather than a world-anchored ARCore/ARKit experience. GPS and device compass accuracy vary, and the path is not physically pinned to sidewalks or buildings in the camera image. Camera and motion sensor access requires HTTPS or localhost, and permission support varies by device. The map uses OpenStreetMap tiles with visible attribution. Set public `VITE_OSM_TILE_URL` in `client/.env` to another compatible provider if needed, following that provider's terms. Keep awareness of surroundings while walking.

## Preferences and privacy

Travel type, budget, walking preference, sustainability preference, and selected coordinates are stored in browser local storage. Location access uses browser geolocation only after the user presses the location button; manual coordinates and place-name search are also available. API keys are never requested in the client.

## Troubleshooting

- **Places returns 403:** Verify billing, key restrictions, and Places API (New) enablement.
- **Places key missing:** Add `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` to `server/.env`, then restart the API.
- **Weather unavailable:** Verify `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`; recommendations still work with neutral context when weather cannot be fetched.
- **Walking routes unavailable:** Enable Routes API, verify billing and the `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` restriction, and restart the server.
- **MongoDB connection warning:** Start MongoDB or remove `MONGODB_URI`; live recommendations still start.
- **Browser cannot reach API:** Start the server on port 5000 and client on 5173. Set `CLIENT_URL` to the client origin if it differs.
- **Deployed/mobile site says the API URL is not configured:** Set `VITE_API_URL` in the frontend hosting build settings to the public backend URL ending in `/api`, then rebuild. Deploying the Git repository or frontend alone does not run the Express API.
- **Deployed API returns a CORS error:** Set backend `CLIENT_URL` to the exact frontend origin (scheme + host), then restart/redeploy the backend.
- **Geolocation is unavailable:** Browser geolocation requires a secure context (HTTPS or localhost) and permission. Enter coordinates or search for a location instead.
- **No nearby attractions:** Try another location or a larger radius with the nearby endpoint.
- **No community businesses appear:** Verify `MONGODB_URI`, confirm the API connected to MongoDB, and approve the listing in `/businesses/admin`.
- **Business admin is unavailable:** Configure `BUSINESS_ADMIN_TOKEN` on the backend and redeploy/restart it. Enter that same token in the admin page; do not add it to any `VITE_` variable.
- **A business suggestion is not visible:** It remains pending until an admin verifies the listing. Sustainability evidence requires a separate review.
- **TypeScript/build errors:** Run `npm run build` from the project root to compile both workspaces.
